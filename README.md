VBA Homework: The VBA of Wall Street
I submitted three separate bas script files. The filenames of the script files should indicate which part of the homework. You can run each script separately, in order, or you could just run the last one, as I believe it does everything that scripts 1 and 2 do also.  

## Instructions
1) moderate_solution.bas

## BONUS
2) hard_solution.bas
3) Every_Wksht.bas 

I also submitted 3 screenshots, one for each year of the final Excel Workbook.
